The main idea of the project is to detect the basic nutrional content of fruits and vegetables by considering the weight of the object.
The weight of the object is detected using LoadCell and the object is detected using webcam.
Once the object is detected the weight is calculated in the loadcell.
The calculated weight is the product of the weight per gram and weight of the object..
